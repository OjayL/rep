IBM Capstone project showing detailed analysis of technological data. The project shows how data was collected, cleaned, extracted and analysed for the purpose of getting insights and also predicting future trends. All that has been done on this data has been documented on the platform from collection, to data wrangling, to exploratory data analysis, to visualization and finally to presentation. Conclusions were made based on the findings as the visualizations show what was happening at the time and what will happen in the nearest future.
